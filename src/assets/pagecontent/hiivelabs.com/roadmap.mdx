    ## Roadmap

    I've been working on the vague concept of writing a roguelike for many years, but I've never quite gotten around
    to it â€“- at least, not in earnest.

    I've done a little digging into the past to determine when I started seriously thinking about it (which I recall
    was around 2010, though the earliest physical prototypes I can find date from 2014). That's probably a good
    enough marker for the start, even if it might be a bit of a fudge.

    For the sake of my own curiosity, I thought it would be interesting to put together a timeline of my work on
    various roguelike-related projects over the years in an attempt to chronicle my progress.

    I'll keep it updated as I make further progress and adjust any future projections to more closely align with
    eventual reality, as I'm pretty sure my estimates will bear no relationship to how long it actually takes to do
    something. Software development estimates are tough enough to get right even when most factors are known; in
    this case, there are unknowns both in terms of the research that needs to be done and the time I can find to
    work on it.

                Work began on a prototype basic roguelike a few weeks before this date, using temporary assets
                from a prior project.
                The aim was to test the workability of various procedural generation techniques to get the feel
                for how much effort would be involved in putting together a basic effort.

                Most likely I was inspired by playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/98800">Dungeons of
                Dredmor</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/207430">Hack, Slash, Loot</a>, both of
                which had come out a few years before, but that I had been too busy to really play.

                #### Early 2019

                Probably the next time I got a chance to delve into roguelike was in early 2019 when I started
                playing around with various procedural generation techniques and built several libraries in C# that
                ultimately resulted in the demos and prototypes that are detailed in the earliest blog posts on this
                site.

                Life -- as it has a habit of doing -- got in the way, and I wasn't able to devote any spare time
                to programming due to various external factors too boring to go into here. Ultimately, it wasn't
                until early 2023 that I was able to get back into it.

                By then, of course, technology had moved on and Rust came to by attention as a promising target for
                game development. Not only that, but developing in Rust would serve as a good learning exercise that
                would be potentially useful in my primary career.
