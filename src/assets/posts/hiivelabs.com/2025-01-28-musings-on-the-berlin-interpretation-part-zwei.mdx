# \*\* THIS ARTICLE IS A WIP! It's not yet finished! \*\*

## Revisiting Berlin...
About six months ago, I wrote a [post](/blog/gamedev/2024/07/11/musings-on-the-berlin-interpretation)
critiquing the original Berlin Interpretation of roguelike games, That piece generated some thoughtful discussion, which
led me to reflect further on how I might improve and refine the interpretation to account for all the developments and
advances in the genre since 2008.

## A Modest Proposal...
At its core, this post proposes a modernized definition. The goal is to preserve the genre’s roots while providing a
framework that accommodates the creativity and diversity seen in today’s designs.

If you want a soundbite to take away, then it would be that a roguelike is a:

*- “procedurally generated high-stakes tactical adventure simulator (or some qualified combination thereof)”*.

For a game to considered be a roguelike, it doesn't have to check *all* of those boxes -- just most of them.

So here, for your edification, delight and/or scorn is...

# <em> "The Hiive Interpretation" </em>

## I. Introduction
The roguelike genre has a rich history, evolving from humble beginnings into a diverse and innovative space. As games
continue to push the boundaries of design, revisiting the foundational ideas behind roguelikes can provide clarity and
inspiration for future projects.

### Context and Purpose
The Berlin Interpretation, established in 2008, was a milestone for codifying key roguelike principles such as
procedural generation, permadeath, and non-modality (although other attempted definitions of the genre existed long
before 2008).

Modern roguelike games seem to have evolved and reinterpreted these principles to create distinct emergent styles:

- ***Tactical Depth***: Games like <WikiLink wiki_id="Dungeon_Crawl_Stone_Soup">*Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (DCSS)*</WikiLink>
    and <SteamLink steam_id="722730">*Cogmind*</SteamLink> use procedural generation to craft unpredictable,
    high-stakes scenarios where every decision matters.
- ***Adventure Simulation***: Titles like <SteamLink steam_id="333640">*Caves of Qud*</SteamLink> and
    <SteamLink steam_id="975370">*Dwarf Fortress*</SteamLink> prioritize systemic reactivity, letting players shape
    stories through interactions with a living world.

These styles aren’t mutually exclusive -- for example, <SteamLink steam_id="333640">*Caves of Qud*</SteamLink>
blends tactical play with procedural storytelling and large scale world simulation.

Often, but not always, these efforts are open source and free with many contributors, but many commercial roguelikes
exist, written by small teams or solo developers. The nature of roguelike development is -- in many ways -- simpler than
many other game genres, lowering the barrier for entry for nascent game programmers.

Other modern games like <SteamLink steam_id="1145360">Hades</SteamLink>, <SteamLink steam_id="250900">Binding of Isaac</SteamLink>,
and <SteamLink steam_id="588650">Dead Cells</SteamLink> exhibit the influence of roguelikes, while titles such
as <SteamLink steam_id="646570">*Slay the Spire*</SteamLink> and <SteamLink steam_id="2379780">*Balatro*</SteamLink>
demonstrate new mechanics (in this case, deck building) that blur the lines between genres. These shifts in the
gaming landscape call for a more nuanced understanding of what defines a roguelike today.

Note that some consider roguelite to be a derogatory term. I need to make it clear that is not how its use is intended
here. In this article, roguelite refers to a game that borrows some design principles from roguelike games (commonly
the procedural generation or permadeath aspects), and melds them with another game genre. Because of this, roguelites
are often referred to by a genre portmanteau, such as "action-roguelite" or "deck-builder-roguelite".

(Of course, they're sometimes also referred to as roguelikes -- but that's another issue, and one that only serves to
unhelpfully muddy the definitions further. Personally, I refer to games such as
<SteamLink steam_id="333640">*Caves of Qud*</SteamLink> as "traditional roguelikes", whereas a I would call a game like
<SteamLink steam_id="677120">*Heroes of Hammerwatch*</SteamLink> a "roguelite" or "action roguelite". Part of
the purpose of writing this definition is to clear up some of the confusion regarding genre classification of these
types of game.)

With that in mind, this article builds on my earlier critique of the Berlin Interpretation, offering a revised framework
that reflects modern approaches while maintaining the genre’s core identity.

### A Personal Lens
While this piece represents my own perspective on the topic, I see it as more than just a theoretical exercise.

It’s an opportunity to clarify my own understanding of the genre and the kind of game I want to create. I welcome debate
and discussion, knowing full well that agreement isn’t guaranteed -- it’s through these conversations that the genre
continues to evolve.

Besides, pretty much every other rogueli<span class="equation-snippet">$x$</span>e[^1] developer has an opinion
on this, so here's mine...

[^1]: Where: <span class="equation-snippet" style="position:relative; top: 4px;">$x \in \set{k|t}$</span>

### Objective
Roguelikes are, to me, about thriving in relentless, unpredictable environments that challenge players to adapt and
overcome. They reward tactical decision-making, resource management, and improvisation, creating high-stakes gameplay
where every choice matters. While roguelites emphasize action and meta-progression, roguelikes remain intimate,
methodical and tactical experiences defined by their emergent stories and systemic complexity.

In my opinion, roguelikes are defined by how they apply foundational principles, not rigid adherence to tradition.
My goal is to create a game that embraces systemic complexity and player agency -- leveraging procedural generation for
tactical depth, meaningful stakes (but not necessarily permadeath), and non-modality for immersion
(where appropriate) -- while welcoming innovations like dynamic storytelling, limited meta-progression and the
capabilities of modern computers.

### Legacy and Evolution
The roguelike genre has its roots in early classics like <WikiLink wiki_id="Rogue_(video_game)">*Rogue*</WikiLink>,
<WikiLink wiki_id="NetHack">*NetHack*</WikiLink>, <SteamLink steam_id="333300">*Ancient  Domains of Mystery (ADOM)*</SteamLink>
and <SteamLink steam_id="259680">*Tales of Maj'Eyal (ToME)*</SteamLink>.
These games laid the groundwork for procedural exploration, tense encounters, and meaningful consequences, which remain
essential to the genre’s appeal.

In my view, there’s plenty of room for the genre to evolve without losing its identity. Modern tools like AI-driven
procedural generation and dynamic narrative systems offer exciting opportunities to build on these foundations.
The challenge lies in balancing tactical depth and improvisation with innovations that add to, rather than detract
from, what makes roguelikes distinctive.

## II. Core Tenets   *(Non-Negotiable)*
Roguelikes are built around a set of fundamental principles that define the genre. While individual games may experiment
and innovate, these core tenets provide the foundation for what makes a roguelike unique.

### Procedural Generation
Procedural generation lies at the heart of roguelikes, ensuring that every run is unpredictable and distinct.
This randomness fuels emergent gameplay, where systems interact in surprising ways to create unique challenges.

#### Emergent Worlds
Each new playthrough begins in an uncharted world, with layouts, creatures, and loot shuffled to keep players on their
toes. This unpredictability forces players to adapt, as they can’t rely on memorized maps or patterns. Even after
repeated attempts, there’s always the chance of discovering an unexpected encounter or hidden feature that prompts a
new mode of tactical play.

#### Balanced Unpredictability
While randomness is essential, it’s most compelling when paired with thoughtful design. Games like
<SteamLink steam_id="333640">*Caves of Qud*</SteamLink> achieve this by anchoring their worlds with consistent faction
ecosystems, ensuring that even unpredictable events feel grounded in logic.
Similarly, <WikiLink wiki_id="Dungeon_Crawl_Stone_Soup">*DCSS*</WikiLink> balances procedural
generation with carefully tuned systems, creating a sense of coherence without sacrificing variety.

By blending chaos with structure, roguelikes ensure that every playthrough is dynamic yet strategic, rewarding players
who adapt to changing circumstances.

### Tactical Pacing
Tactical pacing is a defining feature of roguelikes, emphasizing deliberate, methodical decision-making over quick
reflexes. Whether players are managing movement, attacks, or abilities, the focus is on careful planning, where each
action can carry significant consequences.

#### Turn-Based or Pauseable Real-Time
Roguelikes prioritize tactical thinking by offering turn-based gameplay or real-time systems with the option to pause.
These mechanics allow players to assess their situation and make informed decisions before committing to their next
action.

Turn-based roguelikes, such as <WikiLink wiki_id="NetHack">*NetHack*</WikiLink>, or
<SteamLink steam_id="2125420">*Zorbus*</SteamLink>, give players the space to carefully weigh their moves, while games
like <SteamLink steam_id="212680">*FTL: Faster Than Light*</SteamLink> use a pauseable real-time system to achieve a
similar level of tactical control. Both approaches reward foresight and encourage players to think critically about
positioning, timing, and resource use.


#### Exclusion of Reflex-Driven Gameplay
In contrast to action roguelites like <SteamLink steam_id="1145360">Hades</SteamLink>,
<SteamLink steam_id="1649240">*Returnal*</SteamLink>, or the *Risk of Rain* series
<sup>(<SteamLink steam_id="248820">1</SteamLink>,
    <SteamLink steam_id="632360">2</SteamLink>,
    <SteamLink steam_id="1337520">3</SteamLink>)</sup>, roguelikes avoid reflex-driven gameplay.
These games emphasize thoughtful choices and improvisation over quick reactions. While action roguelites offer fast-paced
excitement, roguelikes create engagement through intentional pacing, where each move can be considered carefully.
There are no real-time limited decisions in a roguelike, other than those you set for yourself.

### Character-Focused Gameplay
Roguelikes often place a strong emphasis on individual characters or small parties, where every decision feels personal.
This focus heightens the stakes, as the survival of the player’s character -- or group -- determines the outcome of the
run.

#### Individual or Small-Party Emphasis
Focusing on a single character -- or a small, tightly-knit group -- naturally heightens the stakes. Unlike larger-scale
strategy games like <WikiLink wiki_id="X-COM:_UFO_Defense">*XCOM: UFO Defense*</WikiLink>, roguelikes often revolve
around a single hero whose survival is paramount. Every injury or setback feels personal, amplifying the tension of
every turn or encounter.

As new abilities, equipment, and challenges arise, this narrow focus encourages players to think carefully about how
best to develop and protect their characters. The result is a dynamic experience where even minor decisions can have
long-term consequences.

The gallery below contrasts XCOM’s squad-management interface and mechanics — such as permadeath spread across multiple
units and a focus on macro-level strategy — with the intimate, singular focus of roguelike design.

### Meaningful Consequences
One of the defining features of roguelikes is the importance of consequences. Whether through the threat of permadeath,
major penalties, or other setbacks, these games challenge players to approach every decision with caution and purpose.
The stakes are always high, ensuring that every run feels significant.

#### Permadeath or Major Penalties
Permadeath is perhaps the most iconic mechanic in roguelikes, representing the ultimate form of consequence. A single
mistake can end a run, forcing players to start over from scratch. This high-risk dynamic adds a unique layer of tension
to every decision, as players must balance their desire to explore or push forward with the need to survive.

In shorter roguelikes, this all-or-nothing approach can create a satisfying rhythm of trial and error. Starting fresh
becomes part of the game’s appeal, encouraging players to adapt and refine their strategies with each attempt. For
example, in <WikiLink wiki_id="NetHack">*NetHack*</WikiLink> or
<WikiLink wiki_id="Brogue_(video_game)">*Brogue*</WikiLink>, losing a high-level character can be devastating, but the
lessons learned along the way prepare players for future runs.

However, in longer campaigns or more expansive roguelikes, permadeath can become overly punishing. Imagine losing dozens
of hours of progress in a sprawling, story-driven roguelike such as <SteamLink steam_id="333640">*Caves of Qud*</SteamLink>
-- a frustration that could turn away even dedicated players. To address this, many modern games implement alternatives
such as:

- **Partial resets**, where players retain some progress or resources between runs.
- **Intermittent checkpoints**, offering a chance to recover from defeat without completely starting over.
- **Recoverable conditions**, such as penalties that can be offset through in-game actions.

These systems allow for a more forgiving experience while preserving the tension and challenge that make roguelikes
unique, and are often implemented in **addition to** permadeath-based play for the more hardcore players.

#### Permissible Meta-Progression
While roguelikes traditionally emphasize self-contained runs, some meta-progression can add depth and replayability
without undermining the genre’s core principles. Persistent elements such as unlockable character classes, subtle
upgrades, or narrative expansions reward long-term engagement while leaving the core challenge intact.

For instance, games like <SteamLink steam_id="212680">*FTL*</SteamLink> allow players to unlock new ships or layouts
after achieving specific milestones, providing variety without diminishing the tension of individual runs.
Similarly, lore-based progression, as seen in <SteamLink steam_id="333300">*ADOM*</SteamLink>,
enhances the world’s richness while keeping each playthrough unpredictable.

In my view, the best meta-progression systems enhance the roguelike experience by encouraging exploration and
experimentation, rather than just making the game easier. They offer players something to work toward over time,
but they never overshadow the immediacy and high stakes of each individual run.

### Emergent Complexity
Roguelikes stand out for their ability to create systems that interact in surprising and meaningful ways. Instead of
relying on pre-scripted scenarios, these games thrive on emergent gameplay, where a combination of mechanics and
player choices results in unique, often unexpected outcomes. This complexity keeps players engaged by encouraging
experimentation and rewarding creative problem-solving.

#### Interlocking Systems
The best roguelikes create a web of interconnected systems that constantly interact. Environmental hazards, enemy
behaviors, and player abilities are designed to influence one another, often in ways that feel organic rather than
scripted. For instance, a fireball spell might ignite flammable terrain, setting off a chain reaction that alters the
course of an encounter.

This interactivity drives engagement by encouraging players to think beyond immediate problems and consider the broader
implications of their actions. Games like <SteamLink steam_id="975370">*Dwarf Fortress*</SteamLink> *(in Adventure Mode)*
exemplify this, offering systems so deeply interconnected that even small changes ripple outward in unpredictable ways.


#### Living, Reactive Worlds
A reactive game world amplifies the sense of agency and immersion. In my opinion, the most engaging roguelikes feature
environments that respond dynamically to player decisions, creating opportunities for both success and failure.
Factions might shift their alliances, creatures could adapt to repeated strategies, or the world itself might evolve
based on the player’s impact.

For example, <SteamLink steam_id="2330750">*Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead (CDDA)*</SteamLink> offers the option of keeping
the same persistent world across multiple runs. When a character dies, everything that occurred in that playthrough --
destroyed buildings, altered vehicles, dropped items -- remains for the next survivor to discover or reclaim.
It’s possible to encounter your previous corpse or salvage your former equipment, lending a tangible feeling that the
world remembers and reflects the consequences of each run.
This continuity shifts the perspective from a lone survivor’s story to an ongoing, emergent narrative in a single,
evolving environment.

By weaving reactivity into their systems, roguelikes encourage players to consider the broader impact of every choice,
strengthening both the challenge and the sense of immersion.

## III. Movement, Positioning, and Interface
Tactical movement and positioning lie at the core of roguelike gameplay. The ability to assess the battlefield and make
purposeful choices about where to move -- or when to hold position -- can mean the difference between survival and defeat.
A clear and intuitive interface is essential to support these decisions, ensuring players have the information they
need to play the game effectively.

### Tactical Spatial Clarity
Roguelikes thrive on providing players with clear spatial mechanics that allow for meaningful positional decisions.
Whether the design uses grids, hexes, or discrete zones, the key is ensuring that each movement feels deliberate.
For instance, <SteamLink steam_id="590380">*Into the Breach*</SteamLink> uses a tile-based system to highlight every
action’s consequences, giving players complete visibility into potential outcomes.

<SteamLink steam_id="1534980">*Terminus: Zombie Survivors*</SteamLink> offers an alternative approach by combining a
graph-based overworld map with grid-based nodes for each specific building or structure. On the overworld, players
choose their next destination node from a web of interconnected points. Once inside a node, movement and combat initiation
occur on a grid, governed by action points that determine how many moves or actions can be taken before ending the turn.
After the player uses these points, zombies move in response, reinforcing the importance of thoughtful positioning and
resourceful tactics.

By blending a broad, node-based travel map with localized grid-based environments, the game ensures that every
decision -- from where to go next to how to maneuver through a cramped building -- carries significant tactical weight.

### Aesthetic Freedom
While roguelikes have traditionally embraced ASCII or tile-based visuals, the genre has grown to accommodate a wide
variety of art styles. Whether a game uses pixel art, 3D models, a hybrid aesthetic, or even ASCII(!), the visual design
should prioritize readability above all else.

For example, a game might use color coding or subtle animations to differentiate terrain types or enemy behaviors.
The focus should remain on ensuring that players can parse the environment at a glance, allowing for quick and informed
decision-making without sacrificing immersion.

### Seamless Flow
Many classic roguelikes integrate exploration and combat seamlessly, with both occurring in the same continuous space.
This approach often enhances immersion, as players transition fluidly between tactical planning and action. However,
segmented systems -- such as card-based mechanics in <SteamLink steam_id="646570">*Slay the Spire*</SteamLink> -- or
modal systems, like those used in <SteamLink steam_id="1534980">*Terminus: Zombie Survivors*</SteamLink>, can also work
effectively if they maintain the game’s emphasis on thoughtful decision-making.

The latter demonstrates this by balancing its modal combat with a dynamic overworld exploration system, ensuring that
the flow of the game remains consistent and engaging. While the combat is distinct from the movement phase, the design
preserves the tension and stakes of every decision, a hallmark of the roguelike experience.

## IV. Resource Management and Exploration
Roguelikes challenge players to make the most of limited resources while navigating unpredictable environments.
The scarcity of supplies creates a constant tension, forcing players to weigh risks and rewards as they explore.
Every decision -- from using a health potion to venturing into an unknown area -- can have significant consequences,
making resource management and exploration central to the roguelike experience.

### Scarcity and Allocation
Effective resource management lies at the heart of roguelike gameplay. Players are often faced with difficult choices,
such as whether to use a health potion now or save it for a potentially more dangerous encounter later. This
scarcity heightens the stakes, turning even routine encounters into moments of strategic planning.

In games like <SteamLink steam_id="212680">*FTL*</SteamLink>, players must carefully allocate limited resources, knowing
that overspending on one resource could leave them vulnerable later. Similarly, in
<WikiLink wiki_id="Brogue_(video_game)">*Brogue*</WikiLink> and others, food management adds another layer of tension,
as prolonged exploration risks starvation. This constant pressure encourages players to think ahead, prioritize their
needs, and adapt their strategies on the fly.

### Secrets and Risk-Reward Discovery

Exploration in roguelikes is often about more than simply grabbing an amulet and then finding the exit -- it’s about
uncovering hidden opportunities and navigating the dangers that come with them. Many games hide rare loot, secret
passageways, or powerful artifacts in hard-to-reach or hazardous areas, tempting players to take risks for potential
rewards.

For instance, in <WikiLink wiki_id="Dungeon_Crawl_Stone_Soup">*DCSS*</WikiLink>, players can encounter treasure vaults
and heavily guarded chambers containing valuable equipment or consumables. Accessing these rewards usually requires
defeating powerful enemies or navigating environmental hazards, forcing players to weigh the potential gain against the
risks to their survival. These mechanics reward players who carefully assess their surroundings and take calculated risks.

### Adaptive Tactics

Procedural generation ensures that no two runs are the same, requiring players to continuously adapt their tactics to
new challenges. Each map layout, enemy spawn, or resource placement demands fresh strategies, preventing players from
relying solely on memorization. This adaptability keeps gameplay dynamic and ensures that players are always engaged,
responding to the unique challenges of each run.

## V. Reduced Emphasis on Grand Strategy
Roguelikes tend to focus on immediate, tactical decisions rather than long-term strategic planning. While some games
incorporate higher-level systems, the heart of the roguelike experience lies in responding to challenges as they arise.
This immediacy creates a sense of urgency and tension that defines the genre, ensuring that moment-to-moment gameplay
remains engaging and impactful.

### Immediate Stakes
Unlike strategy games that emphasize overarching plans and resource management over extended timelines, roguelikes
prioritize the here and now. Each decision -- whether it’s choosing when to heal, where to move, or how to engage an
enemy -- has immediate consequences that shape the outcome of a run.

For example, in <SteamLink steam_id="811320">*Jupiter Hell*</SteamLink>, players must carefully balance their
positioning and ability usage in every combat scenario, as a single misstep can result in swift death. This focus on
short-term stakes keeps the player’s attention on the tactical layer, where split-second choices and improvisation
determine survival.

### Balancing Meta-Layers
While some roguelikes integrate strategic elements, these systems are usually secondary to the immediate challenges of
each run. Games like <SteamLink steam_id="1940340">*Darkest Dungeon II*</SteamLink> explore evolving relationships and
larger-scale planning, but the roguelike core remains tied to tactical decision-making within individual encounters.

In my view, roguelikes benefit most when these meta-layers enhance, rather than overshadow, the immediacy of
moment-to-moment gameplay. For example, <SteamLink steam_id="212680">*FTL*</SteamLink> incorporates strategic decisions
about which sectors to explore, but the game’s focus remains on navigating encounters and managing resources in
real-time (although the player can pause at any point). This balance ensures that players stay immersed in the
high-stakes tension that defines the genre.

## VI. Deprecated/Removed BI Elements
As the roguelike genre evolves, certain elements from the original Berlin Interpretation (BI) are arguably no longer
essential. While these features played a significant role in defining early roguelikes, modern interpretations have
shown that their absence doesn’t detract from the genre’s core identity. Instead, the focus has shifted toward
principles that better reflect the diversity of contemporary designs.

### Weakened Permadeath
Traditionally, permadeath was a cornerstone of roguelikes, ensuring that every run carried significant risk. However,
in longer or more complex games, this all-or-nothing mechanic can alienate players by erasing hours of progress after a
single mistake.

Modern roguelikes often adapt permadeath to better suit their design. For example,
<SteamLink steam_id="333640">*Caves of Qud*</SteamLink> offers two optional non-permadeath difficulty mode with
checkpoints, allowing players to recover from setbacks without starting over completely. This approach preserves the
tension of permadeath while offering a less punishing experience for those who prefer it.

By softening the consequences without eliminating them, these games maintain the stakes that define roguelikes while
accommodating a broader range of players. That's not to say that permadeath can't be there as an option for the hardcore
player -- it can, and it should, for those who enjoy the extra challenge.

### Grid-Based Mandate
Grid-based movement has long been a hallmark of roguelikes, providing clarity and structure to tactical decisions.
However, it is no longer an absolute requirement. Games like <SteamLink steam_id="1534980">*Terminus: Zombie Survivors*</SteamLink>
demonstrate that alternative movement systems -- such as Action Points and graph-based overworld navigation -- can offer
equally engaging spatial mechanics.

The key lies in maintaining tactical clarity. Whether using a grid, hexes, or free-form movement, the design should
provide players with enough information to make meaningful choices about positioning and movement. The format is less
important than the system’s ability to support deliberate, tactical play.

### ASCII Requirement
ASCII graphics hold a special place in roguelike history, serving as both a visual style and a practical necessity for
early games. While still beloved by some players, modern roguelikes have embraced a variety of aesthetics.
Pixel art, 3D models, and even hybrid approaches can all work effectively, provided they prioritize readability and
clarity.

For instance, <SteamLink steam_id="811320">*Jupiter Hell*</SteamLink> uses high-quality 3D visuals to represent its
environments and characters while retaining the tactical clarity of its ASCII predecessors.

Other games, including <WikiLink wiki_id="Brogue_(video_game)">*Brogue*</WikiLink> and
<SteamLink steam_id="722730">*Cogmind*</SteamLink> provide the option of choosing ASCII or graphical tiles in-game.

By moving beyond ASCII without sacrificing usability, these games demonstrate that visual innovation can enhance a
roguelike’s appeal without compromising the gameplay.

### Strict Non-Modality
Classic roguelikes often integrated exploration and combat seamlessly within a single interface. While this approach
remains effective, modern roguelikes have shown that modal systems can work just as well. Games like
<SteamLink steam_id="212680">*FTL*</SteamLink> segment different phases of gameplay -- such as exploration and ship
combat -- but maintain a cohesive and strategic experience.

The key is to preserve the player’s focus on tactical decision-making. If a modal system enhances clarity or adds depth
to specific mechanics, it can be a worthwhile departure from the traditional roguelike formula.

### Dungeon-Centric Settings
While many roguelikes take place in sprawling dungeons, the genre’s defining principles -- emergent gameplay, resource
management, and high-stakes exploration -- can be applied to a wide range of settings. Space stations, post-apocalyptic
landscapes, and even abstract environments can serve as compelling backdrops for roguelike gameplay.

For example, <SteamLink steam_id="551620">*Approaching Infinity*</SteamLink> trades traditional dungeon crawling for
starship exploration and planetary away missions, whereas <SteamLink steam_id="342610">*HyperRogue*</SteamLink> warps
the player out of normal space entirely and into a non-Euclidean hyperspace nightmare.

The core identity of a good roguelike transcends its setting. As long as the game fosters tension and unpredictability,
in line with the tenets of the genre, the actual environment can be as varied as the designer’s imagination allows.

## VII. Roguelikes

Traditional roguelikes represent the modern descendants most influenced by early genre-defining titles such as
<WikiLink wiki_id="Rogue_(video_game)">*Rogue*</WikiLink> itself, <WikiLink wiki_id="NetHack">*NetHack*</WikiLink>, and
<SteamLink steam_id="333300">*ADOM*</SteamLink>. These games adhere closely to the foundational concepts that shaped the
genre’s formative years, emphasizing discrete, turn-based movement, single-character progression, and harsh penalties
for failure. In doing so, they uphold the genre’s heritage by focusing on methodical decision-making and
survival-oriented play rather than reflex-based action or extensive meta-progression.

Examples of traditional roguelikes include:
-	<SteamLink steam_id="333640">*Caves of Qud*</SteamLink>: Known for its deep simulation, faction interactions,
        and unpredictable outcomes.
-	<SteamLink steam_id="811320">*Jupiter Hell*</SteamLink>: A sci-fi roguelike that combines turn-based tactics with
        fast-paced decision-making.
-	<WikiLink wiki_id="Brogue_(video_game)">*Brogue*</WikiLink>: A grid-based, turn-based roguelike focusing on resource
        management and tactical combat.
-   <SteamLink steam_id="722730">*Cogmind*</SteamLink>: A traditional roguelike that deeply adheres to classic roguelike
        mechanics while introducing innovative elements unique to its high-tech theme.
-   <SteamLink steam_id="2720010">*Rogue Fable IV*</SteamLink>: A modern traditional roguelike that stays true to
        classic mechanics while adding features for greater depth and accessibility.

### Core Qualities

Though the roguelike genre has broadened substantially, traditional roguelikes remain bound by a few distinct features
that set them apart:
#### Strict Turn-Based Pacing
- Every action -- movement, attacking, using an item -- advances time by a discrete step. This ensures that players can
deliberate over each decision without facing the pressure of a ticking clock.
#### Singular Character Focus
- Many traditional roguelikes place the player in control of exactly one primary character. This intense focus on a
single survivor or hero heightens tension because defeat spells the end of the entire run.
#### Grid-Based Navigation
- Movement typically unfolds on a square or (occasionally) a hex grid, simplifying the geometry of combat and exploration.
This design grants clarity to tactical maneuvers, making precise positioning a critical element of success.
#### Minimal to No Meta-Progression
- In traditional roguelikes, each run stands on its own. Death means losing all progress and items. While some titles may
include optional unlocks or class additions, the emphasis remains on learning the game’s systems rather than accruing
permanent upgrades across multiple attempts.
#### ASCII or Simple Tile Aesthetic
- Many classic roguelikes rely on ASCII or basic tile sets, though visuals vary widely in modern counterparts. Regardless
of style, readability and conveying vital information are always prioritized over pretty graphics.

### Lasting Appeal
For many players, the allure of traditional roguelikes lies in their uncompromising approach to challenge and
consequence. Permadeath rewards patience and planning, pushing players to learn from mistakes and refine their
strategies. By restricting meta-systems that carry over between runs, these games reinforce the importance of
moment-to-moment decisions and the organic mastery of complex systems.

### Contemporary Role
Some modern roguelikes and roguelites have introduced faster pacing, reflex elements, and persistent upgrades, but
traditional roguelikes continue to thrive in both classic and newly developed titles. They provide a counterbalance to
more action-focused designs, offering a pure, methodical experience that remains beloved by those who prefer careful
deliberation, emergent complexity, and the high stakes of permanent failure.

By acknowledging these roots, developers and players can appreciate the breadth of the genre -- from its hardcore,
old-school constraints to the varied, innovative forms it takes today.

### Case Studies
Examining specific games helps illustrate the diversity within the roguelike and roguelite genres, showcasing how
different design choices align with -- or diverge from -- the core principles discussed. Below, I’ve selected a few
examples that highlight these distinctions.

#### Roguelikes (Traditional and Systemic)
Roguelikes emphasize systemic depth, procedural generation, and high-stakes gameplay. While traditional roguelikes
often feature turn-based mechanics and grid-based movement, the category has grown to include games that maintain the
genre’s tactical focus and emergent complexity, even with alternative approaches to pacing and interface. These games
challenge players to adapt to unpredictable environments, with each run offering unique challenges and opportunities.

The following non-exhaustive list of examples demonstrate these principles:

- <SteamLink steam_id="333640">*Caves of Qud*</SteamLink>: A modernized traditional roguelike that exemplifies
    emergent complexity and procedural depth (with its "layer cake of thousand-year-old civilizations”).
    Its faction systems and richly simulated world allow for unpredictable, highly personalized experiences.
    Players might encounter a wandering merchant one run and find themselves on the wrong side of their faction the next.
    This variability reinforces the game’s tactical depth and replayability. upgrades.

- <SteamLink steam_id="1519490">*Doors of Trithius*</SteamLink>: A traditional roguelike blending retro-inspired aesthetics
    with deep tactical gameplay. The game features an expansive world map connecting procedurally generated dungeons, towns, and wilderness, offering
    players the freedom to explore a dynamic world.
    Its faction system introduces nuanced interactions, where alliances or rivalries can influence encounters and quests.
    With a robust class system, item-based progression, and unpredictable challenges, the game demands adaptability and
    tactical thinking.

- <SteamLink steam_id="497800">Golden Krone Hotel</SteamLink>: A distinctive roguelike that innovates with its vampire-themed
    setting and dynamic mechanics.
    The game challenges players to navigate a procedurally generated hotel while managing the unique duality of human and
    vampire forms, each offering different abilities and tactical advantages.
    Dynamic lighting and potion mechanics introduce environmental interactions, where sunlight and shadows play a critical
    role in survival.

- <WikiLink wiki_id="Dungeon_Crawl_Stone_Soup">*Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (DCSS)*</WikiLink>: A quintessential example of a traditional roguelike that
    emphasizes grid-based movement, turn-based combat, and meaningful resource management. Its diverse character builds and
    procedurally generated dungeons challenge players to adapt their strategies on the fly, ensuring that no two runs feel
    the same.

- <SteamLink steam_id="811320">*Jupiter Hell*</SteamLink>: Blending the sci-fi setting of Doom with traditional roguelike mechanics,
     delivers turn-based tactical gameplay with a modern twist. Its
    clear interface and tactical pacing make every decision impactful, while its procedural design ensures consistent
    replayability.

- <SteamLink steam_id="212680">*FTL: Faster Than Light*</SteamLink>: While not quite a traditional roguelike, this game
    embraces procedural generation,
    high-stakes decision-making, and resource management. Its real-time-with-pause mechanics balance tactical and strategic
    elements, offering a fresh interpretation of roguelike principles within a sci-fi framework. The developers refer to
    their game as a "roguelike-like", but in my opinion it qualifies as a modern roguelike.

- <WikiLink wiki_id="Brogue_(video_game)">*Brogue*</WikiLink>: Grid-based movement, turn-based combat, and procedurally
    generated dungeons.
    It exemplifies classic roguelike design, with a heavy emphasis
    on environmental interactions, resource management, and emergent gameplay.
    Players must carefully navigate traps, utilize consumables strategically, and adapt to a variety of procedurally
    generated challenges.

- <SteamLink steam_id="975370">*Dwarf Fortress (Adventure Mode)*</SteamLink>: Procedural complexity, emergent
    storytelling, and high-stakes tactical play. The Adventure Mode
    offers a highly simulated world where players control a single
    character navigating dynamic environments. Interactions with factions, creatures, and environments lead to unpredictable,
    story-driven gameplay.

#### The Gray Area: Hybrid Roguelikes
Hybrid roguelikes blend traditional roguelike mechanics with elements from other genres, creating unique gameplay
experiences. These games often incorporate tactical decision-making while introducing innovations that set them apart
from both conventional roguelikes and roguelites, placing them in a categorization gray area.

The following non-exhaustive list provides some examples of hybrid roguelikes.

- <SteamLink steam_id="975370">*Dwarf Fortress (Fortess Mode)*</SteamLink>: Combines traditional roguelike elements like procedural
    generation and emergent complexity with colony management and simulation mechanics. In Fortress Mode, players oversee
    the construction and operation of a sprawling settlement, managing resources, citizens, and external threats.
    The roguelike influence is evident in the unpredictability of events, the high stakes of decisions, and the emergent
    storytelling that arises from interactions between the environment, creatures, and dwarves. However, its focus on
    large-scale planning and indirect control over individual units places it firmly in the hybrid category, blending
    roguelike principles with a deep simulation experience.

- <SteamLink steam_id="329970">*KeeperRL*</SteamLink>: With grid-based movement, turn-based mechanics, and a mix of
    roguelike and simulation elements, this game combines traditional dungeon-building mechanics with roguelike
    exploration and combat, allowing players to control both individual units and broader dungeon systems.

- <SteamLink steam_id="243970">*Invisible, Inc.*</SteamLink>: Merges traditional roguelike elements, such as procedurally
    generated missions and turn-based tactical decision-making, with strategic team management features commonly found in
    strategy games like <WikiLink wiki_id="X-COM:_UFO_Defense">*XCOM*</WikiLink>. The game focuses on controlling a small
    team of agents, requiring players to manage resources, plan coordinated actions, and make strategic decisions at both
    the mission and operational levels.

## VIII. Roguelites
The terms “roguelike” and “roguelite” are often used interchangeably, but they represent distinct branches of the genre.
While they share foundational elements like procedural generation and high replayability, their core design philosophies
differ significantly. Understanding these distinctions helps clarify what sets traditional roguelikes apart from their
more action-oriented counterparts.

Roguelikes emphasize methodical pacing, systemic depth, and high-stakes gameplay. These games challenge players to
navigate procedurally generated environments while making deliberate, tactical decisions. Each run is largely
self-contained, with minimal reliance on persistent upgrades or meta-progression.

Roguelites, by contrast, often incorporate elements of reflex-driven gameplay and/or extensive meta-progression.
They appeal to a broader audience by incorporating aspects of more popular genres and are often more approachable
than traditional roguelikes for the casual player. Traditional roguelikes are (arguably correctly) viewed by
non-aficionados as having a very steep learning curve and having ugly, primitive graphics, although this is changing
with the advent of some of the more modern efforts.

Roguelites can be broadly broken into categories, based on their primary non-roguelike characteristics. This is not
something I want to go into too much detail here, as my primary focus is on roguelikes, but I would suggest that a
reasonable categorization scheme for roguelites could be based on which of the core roguelike tenets they **do not**
adhere to.

The primary defining tenets that we can consider are "Strict Turn-Based Pacing", "Singular Character Focus"
and "Minimal to No Meta-Progression". The other tenets, "Grid-Based Navigation" and "ASCII or Simple Tile Aesthetic" are
frequently discarded along with a corresponding primary tenet. The descriptor roguelite tends to be more frequently
applied to games in which the turn-based mechanic is supplanted with real-time action, but this is by no means
universal.

As an important aside, as long as the modifier is applied, the terms *\[category modifier\] rogueli**t**e* and
*\[category modifier\] rogueli**k**e* are semantically equivalent. The term roguelite should then perhaps be reserved
for the overarching category of games that omit one or more of the core tenets.

### Case Studies
To illustrate this, consider the following sets of non-exhaustive examples:
- Games that are real-time as opposed to turn-based are *action roguelites*.

    Examples include:

    -	<SteamLink steam_id="1145360">*Hades*</SteamLink>: Combines fast-paced combat with a deep narrative and persistent
            upgrades.
    -	<SteamLink steam_id="588650">*Dead Cells*</SteamLink>: Fuses platforming and hack-and-slash combat with unlockable
            weapons and abilities.
    -	*Rogue Legacy* <SteamLink steam_id="241600">1</SteamLink> and <SteamLink steam_id="1253920">2</SteamLink>:
            Features generational meta-progression, where each new character inherits traits and upgrades from previous
            runs. The sequel expands the formula with class-altering traits, biome-specific progression, and evolving
            relics, deepening the legacy-building mechanics.
    -	*Heroes of Hammerwatch* <SteamLink steam_id="677120">*1*</SteamLink> and <SteamLink steam_id="619820">*2*</SteamLink>:
            Blends action RPG mechanics with procedural generation and persistent town upgrades.
    -	<SteamLink steam_id="250900">Binding of Isaac</SteamLink>: Features fast-paced, reflex-heavy gameplay with
            incremental unlocks and item progression across runs.
    -   <WikiLink wiki_id="Spelunky">*Spelunky*</WikiLink> <SteamLink steam_id="239350">*1*</SteamLink> and
            <SteamLink steam_id="418530">*2*</SteamLink>: Incorporate roguelike
            randomness but rely on player reflexes and precise timing to navigate their environments.
    - <WikiLink wiki_id="Diablo_(video_game)">*Diablo*</WikiLink>: Leans heavily on action RPG mechanics, along with a
            rigid story and set pieces. Its use of randomization and high replayability align it with roguelite
            design principles.

Action roguelites usually ditch the grid-based movement as well; turn-based action and grid-based movement are often
closely correlated. However, the converse does not necessarily apply. There are plenty of games that do not use
grid-based movement, and yet remain turn-based.

- Games that do not use grid-based movements but retain the turn-based feature can be categorized based on the primary
    non-roguelike mechanic.
    E.g. Deck-Building, Dice-Placement, etc.

    Examples include:

    - <SteamLink steam_id="646570">*Slay the Spire*</SteamLink>: Turn-based **Deck-building** roguelite where the player
            climbs a branching spire via strategic path choices and card synergies.
    - <SteamLink steam_id="2579980">*Balatro*</SteamLink>: Poker-inspired **deck-building** roguelite where the player
            combines cards into combos while balancing risk/reward to defeat escalating challenges.
    - <SteamLink steam_id="861540">*Dicey Dungeons*</SteamLink>: Turn-based **Dice-placement** roguelite in which the
            player manipulates dice rolls and placements to activate and execute attacks, blending luck with strategy.
    - <SteamLink steam_id="1296610">*Peglin*</SteamLink>: Turn-based **Physics-based** roguelite in which the player
        ricochets orbs off pachinko boards to defeat foes, with upgrades altering orb physics and board layouts.

    />
</LightboxGallery>

- Games that focus on multiple rather than single characters are *squad-based roguelites*.

    Examples include:

    - <SteamLink steam_id="249050">*Dungeon of the Endless*</SteamLink>: Combines roguelike gameplay with tower defense.
        Players control a party of heroes working together to protect a crystal while exploring procedurally generated
        levels. Each hero has unique abilities that influence strategy.
    - <SteamLink steam_id="527230">*For the King*</SteamLink>: A turn-based strategy game with party-based exploration,
        combat, and survival. Players control a group of adventurers on a procedurally generated map, balancing risk
        and reward as they progress.

- Games that implement meta-progression between runs are *advancement roguelites*.

    Examples include:
    - <SteamLink steam_id="1299780">*Warm Snow*</SteamLink>: A fast-paced action roguelite where players unlock
        permanent upgrades (e.g., skill trees, weapons, and passive abilities) between runs. These persistent
        enhancements allow for strategic power growth and customization, encouraging repeated attempts.
    - <SteamLink steam_id="1970580">*Backpack Hero*</SteamLink>: Centers on tactical inventory management, where the
        arrangement of items in your backpack directly affects gameplay. Between runs, players unlock new characters
        and mechanics that expand strategic possibilities and enhance replayability.

#### Categorization
It's important to realize that these categorizations aren't concrete or exclusive. Most of the games in the examples
straddle boundaries between categories. For example, <SteamLink steam_id="241600">*Rogue Legacy*</SteamLink> would also
be considered an *action roguelite*, and <SteamLink steam_id="1145360">*Hades*</SteamLink> is also an *advancement
roguelite*.

#### Relationship
Roguelikes and roguelites are not in competition -- they are complementary approaches to the same foundational ideas.
Roguelites introduce the genre’s concepts to players who may be unfamiliar with its traditional structure, while
roguelikes maintain the tactical depth and emergent complexity that define the genre’s roots. Together, they expand the
roguelike family, offering something for every type of player.

## IX. Addressing Community Concerns
The roguelike community is diverse, encompassing players, developers, and enthusiasts with varied perspectives on what
defines the genre. As the genre evolves, certain concerns and debates have emerged, often centered around preserving
tradition while embracing innovation. This section addresses some of the most common points of contention.

### Legacy Respect

Roguelikes trace their roots to foundational titles like <WikiLink wiki_id="Rogue_(video_game)">*Rogue*</WikiLink>,
<WikiLink wiki_id="NetHack">*NetHack*</WikiLink>, <WikiLink wiki_id="Moria_(1983_video_game)">*Moria*</WikiLink> and
<WikiLink wiki_id="Angband_(video_game)">*Angband*</WikiLink>.
For many in the community, these early games represent the heart of the genre, establishing key principles such as
procedural generation, high-stakes gameplay, and emergent complexity.

While innovation is essential for keeping the genre alive, it’s important to respect these traditions. This doesn’t
mean rigid adherence to past conventions but rather maintaining the core elements that made roguelikes distinctive.
For example, modern games like <SteamLink steam_id="333640">*Caves of Qud*</SteamLink> and
<SteamLink steam_id="811320">*Jupiter Hell*</SteamLink> have successfully built on traditional frameworks while
introducing fresh ideas. By preserving the genre’s defining principles, developers can ensure its legacy remains intact.

### Gatekeeping Guardrails
Defining what constitutes a roguelike has always been a challenge, leading to heated debates within the community.
Clear distinctions (even if they're not fully agreed with) help clarify these boundaries.

For instance, while games like <SteamLink steam_id="1145360">*Hades*</SteamLink> and
<SteamLink steam_id="588650">*Dead Cells*</SteamLink> share certain elements with roguelikes, they lack the tactical
pacing and emergent complexity that define the core experience. These distinctions aren’t meant to gatekeep but to
preserve the genre’s identity and guide players and developers in understanding what sets roguelikes apart. At the
same time, the roguelike family has expanded to include hybrids and roguelites, offering room for innovation without
diluting its core.

### Cultural Conflation
As “roguelike” has become an industry buzzword, its meaning has often been stretched to encompass games that share only
superficial similarities with the genre. Marketing labels frequently misrepresent roguelikes, leading to confusion among
players and developers alike.

The term ‘roguelike’ is often misapplied to games with superficial similarities, diluting its meaning. For instance:

- <SteamLink steam_id="1649240">*Returnal*</SteamLink> markets itself as a roguelike but emphasizes real-time combat and cinematic storytelling over tactical
decision-making.

- <SteamLink steam_id="1313140">*Cult of the Lamb*</SteamLink>, although often labeled otherwise, is not a roguelike
because it features real-time action, incorporates persistent progression and base-building mechanics, focuses on
managing a cult rather than a single character, and lacks traditional roguelike elements like turn-based,
grid-based movement and permanent consequences.

- <SteamLink steam_id="1794680">*Vampire Survivors*</SteamLink> is frequently mislabeled as a roguelike despite its
arcade-style action and minimal consequence for failure.

[//]: # (# Don't Starve)

These examples highlight the need for precise terminology. Distinguishing roguelikes (tactical, systemic, high-stakes)
from roguelites (action-oriented, meta-progression-heavy) preserves the genre’s identity and guides players to experiences
aligned with their preferences.

This mislabeling risks diminishing the value of the term, making it harder for genuine roguelikes to stand out.
Encouraging thoughtful and accurate labeling -- such as distinguishing between roguelikes (and/or traditional roguelikes),
roguelites, and hybrids -- helps preserve the genre’s integrity. By doing so, the community can ensure that roguelikes
retain their distinct identity while allowing room for diverse interpretations and innovations.

## X. Creative Freedom and Evolution

The roguelike genre has always been a space for experimentation and innovation. Its core principles -- procedural
generation, emergent complexity, and high-stakes decision-making -- serve as a foundation that developers can build upon,
exploring new ideas and pushing the boundaries of what the genre can achieve.


### Technology and Player Preferences
Advances in technology have opened up new opportunities for roguelike design. Procedural generation has grown more
sophisticated, allowing for dynamic narratives, evolving environments, and systems-driven gameplay that reacts to player
choices. For example, AI-driven content creation could enable NPCs with unique goals and behaviors, adding depth to
procedural worlds.

In order to attract more players to the genre, more approachable and visually engaging experiences go a long way.
Games like <SteamLink steam_id="811320">*Jupiter Hell*</SteamLink> demonstrate that roguelikes can embrace modern
visuals while retaining their tactical depth.
Similarly, hybrids like <SteamLink steam_id="329970">*KeeperRL*</SteamLink> show how blending genres can attract new
audiences while preserving roguelike principles.

### Adaptive Definition
The roguelike genre’s ability to adapt has been key to its longevity. Rather than adhering to rigid checklists, modern
interpretations embrace the genre’s spirit -- tactical pacing, emergent gameplay, and meaningful consequences -- while
allowing for variation.

This flexibility ensures that roguelikes remain relevant in an ever-changing gaming landscape. Developers are free to
experiment with new mechanics, aesthetics, or narrative techniques, provided they enhance the genre’s core appeal.
For example, games like *Rift Wizard*
(<SteamLink steam_id="1271280">*1*</SteamLink> and <SteamLink steam_id="2058570">*2*</SteamLink>) and
<SteamLink steam_id="646570">*Slay the Spire*</SteamLink> reimagine traditional roguelike elements in
innovative ways, expanding the genre’s possibilities without losing its essence.

## XI. Conclusion
The "hiive interpretation" framework is not meant to be a rigid set of rules but rather a tool for discussion and
reflection. Just as the roguelike genre itself evolves, the hiive interpretation should adapt to accommodate new ideas,
technologies, and player preferences. Its purpose is to preserve the genre’s core identity while encouraging innovation
and diversity within its boundaries.

### Living Document
By design, the hiive interpretation is intended to grow and change. Developers, players, and enthusiasts are invited to
critique, refine, and expand upon its guidelines. This collaborative approach ensures that the framework remains
relevant, reflecting the evolving landscape of roguelikes while maintaining respect for their roots.

For example, as hybrids and roguelites continue to emerge, this interpretation can help clarify how these variations
relate to traditional roguelikes, providing useful distinctions without discouraging creative exploration. The goal is
not to divide but to celebrate the genre’s diversity and richness.

### Call to Action
If this framework sparks new ideas -- or sparks debate -- it has succeeded in its purpose. The roguelike genre thrives
on iteration, both in its gameplay and in how it’s understood. Developers are encouraged to experiment, players to
engage, and communities to discuss and refine what makes roguelikes so compelling.

### Final Pitch
Roguelikes remain a unique and vibrant part of the gaming world, defined by their tactical depth, emergent storytelling,
and unpredictable challenges. Roguelites, while distinct, offer complementary experiences that expand the genre’s reach.

The hiive interpretation seeks to preserve the essential spirit of roguelikes while leaving room for growth,
experimentation, and reinterpretation.

By keeping these principles in mind, the roguelike community can continue to innovate and collaborate, ensuring that the
genre remains as compelling and dynamic as ever.
