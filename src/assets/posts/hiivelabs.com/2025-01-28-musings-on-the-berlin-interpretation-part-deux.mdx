## Revisiting Berlin...
About six months ago, I wrote a [post](/blog/gamedev/2024/07/11/musings-on-the-berlin-interpretation)
critiquing the original Berlin Interpretation of roguelike games, That piece generated some thoughtful discussion, which
led me to reflect further on how I might improve and refine the interpretation to account for all the developments and
advances in the genre since 2008.

## A Modest Proposal...
At its core, this post proposes a modernized definition: a roguelike is a *“procedurally generated high-stakes tactical
adventure simulator”*.

The goal is to preserve the genre’s roots while providing a framework that accommodates the
creativity and diversity seen in today’s designs. So here, for your edification, delight and/or scorn is...

# *"The Hiive Interpretation"*

## I. Introduction
The roguelike genre has a rich history, evolving from humble beginnings into a diverse and innovative space. As games
continue to push the boundaries of design, revisiting the foundational ideas behind roguelikes can provide clarity and
inspiration for future projects.

### Context and Purpose
The Berlin Interpretation, established in 2008, was a milestone for defining roguelikes, but the genre has evolved
dramatically since then. Popular games like *Hades*, *Binding of Isaac*, and *Dead Cells* highlight the growing influence of
roguelites, while titles such as *Slay the Spire* and *Balatro* demonstrate new mechanics (in this case, deck building)
that blur the lines between categories. These shifts in the gaming landscape call for a more nuanced understanding of
what defines a roguelike today.

This article builds on my earlier critique of the Berlin Interpretation, offering a revised framework that reflects
modern approaches while maintaining the genre’s core identity.

### A Personal Lens
While this piece represents my own perspective on the topic, I see it as more than just a theoretical exercise.

It’s an opportunity to clarify my own understanding of the genre and the kind of game I want to create. I welcome debate
and discussion, knowing full well that agreement isn’t guaranteed -- it’s through these conversations that the genre
continues to evolve. Besides -- pretty much every other developer has an opinion on this, so here's mine...

### Objective
Roguelikes are, to me, about thriving in relentless, unpredictable environments that challenge players to adapt and
overcome. They reward tactical decision-making, resource management, and improvisation, creating high-stakes gameplay
where every choice matters. While roguelites emphasize action and meta-progression, roguelikes remain intimate,
strategy-driven experiences defined by their emergent stories and systemic complexity.

This exploration reflects the kind of roguelike I want to create: one that balances tradition with innovation, honoring
the genre’s legacy while embracing modern possibilities.

### Legacy and Evolution
The roguelike genre has its roots in early classics like *Rogue*, *NetHack*, and *Ancient Domains of Mystery (ADOM)*.
These games laid the groundwork for procedural exploration, tense encounters, and meaningful consequences, which remain
essential to the genre’s appeal.

In my view, there’s plenty of room for the genre to evolve without losing its identity. Modern tools like AI-driven
procedural generation and dynamic narrative systems offer exciting opportunities to build on these foundations.
The challenge lies in balancing tactical depth and improvisation with innovations that add to, rather than detract
from, what makes roguelikes distinctive.

## II. Core Tenets   *(Non-Negotiable)*
Roguelikes are built around a set of fundamental principles that define the genre. While individual games may experiment
and innovate, these core tenets provide the foundation for what makes a roguelike unique.

### Procedural Generation
Procedural generation lies at the heart of roguelikes, ensuring that every run is unpredictable and distinct.
This randomness fuels emergent gameplay, where systems interact in surprising ways to create unique challenges.

#### Emergent Worlds
Each new playthrough begins in an uncharted world, with layouts, creatures, and loot shuffled to keep players on their
toes. This unpredictability forces players to adapt, as they can’t rely on memorized maps or patterns. Even after
repeated attempts, there’s always the chance of discovering an unexpected encounter or hidden feature that prompts a
new mode of tactical play.

#### Balanced Unpredictability
While randomness is essential, it’s most compelling when paired with thoughtful design. Games like *Caves of Qud* achieve
this by anchoring their worlds with consistent faction ecosystems, ensuring that even unpredictable events feel grounded
in logic. Similarly, *Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (DCSS)* balances procedural generation with carefully tuned systems,
creating a sense of coherence without sacrificing variety.

By blending chaos with structure, roguelikes ensure that every playthrough is dynamic yet strategic, rewarding players
who adapt to changing circumstances.

### Tactical Pacing
Tactical pacing is a defining feature of roguelikes, emphasizing deliberate, methodical decision-making over quick
reflexes. Whether players are managing movement, attacks, or abilities, the focus is on careful planning, where each
action can carry significant consequences.

#### Turn-Based or Pauseable Real-Time
Roguelikes prioritize tactical thinking by offering turn-based gameplay or real-time systems with the option to pause.
These mechanics allow players to assess their situation and make informed decisions before committing to their next
action.

Turn-based roguelikes, such as *NetHack*, or *Zorbus*, give players the space to carefully weigh their
moves, while games like *FTL* use a pauseable real-time system to achieve a similar level of tactical control. Both
approaches reward foresight and encourage players to think critically about positioning, timing, and resource use.


#### Exclusion of Pure Reflex Combat
In contrast to roguelites like *Hades*, *Returnal*, or the *Risk of Rain* series, roguelikes avoid reflex-driven gameplay.
These games emphasize thoughtful choices and improvisation over quick reactions. While roguelites offer fast-paced
excitement, roguelikes shine by creating tension through strategic pacing, where each move feels intentional and impactful.

By focusing on deliberate decision-making, roguelikes ensure that every action matters, fostering a unique blend of
challenge and engagement.

### Character-Focused Gameplay
Roguelikes often place a strong emphasis on individual characters or small parties, where every decision feels personal.
This focus heightens the stakes, as the survival of the player’s character -- or group -- determines the outcome of the run.

#### Individual or Small-Party Emphasis
Focusing on a single character -- or a small, tightly-knit group -- naturally heightens the stakes. Unlike larger-scale
strategy games like *XCOM*, roguelikes often revolve around a single hero whose survival is paramount.
Every injury or setback feels personal, amplifying the tension of every turn or encounter.

As new abilities, equipment, and challenges arise, this narrow focus encourages players to think carefully about how
best to develop and protect their characters. The result is a dynamic experience where even minor decisions can have
long-term consequences.

#### High-Stakes Development
Permadeath traditionally accompanies character-focused gameplay, raising the stakes by attaching permanent consequences
to failure. Losing a character often means starting over, forcing players to approach challenges with caution and intent.

For longer campaigns, however, some games adapt this approach to reduce frustration. Features like segmented runs,
temporary penalties, or limited revival opportunities can preserve the tension of permadeath while softening its
harshest effects. While permadeath can be softened in longer campaigns, consequences must remain impactful to preserve
tension.
These mechanics reward thoughtful play while accommodating modern preferences for accessibility and
pacing.

### Meaningful Consequences
One of the defining features of roguelikes is the importance of consequences. Whether through the threat of permadeath,
major penalties, or other setbacks, these games challenge players to approach every decision with caution and purpose.
The stakes are always high, ensuring that every run feels significant.

#### Permadeath or Major Penalties
Permadeath is perhaps the most iconic mechanic in roguelikes, representing the ultimate form of consequence. A single
mistake can end a run, forcing players to start over from scratch. This high-risk dynamic adds a unique layer of tension
to every decision, as players must balance their desire to explore or push forward with the need to survive.

In shorter roguelikes, this all-or-nothing approach can create a satisfying rhythm of trial and error. Starting fresh
becomes part of the game’s appeal, encouraging players to adapt and refine their strategies with each attempt. For
example, in *NetHack* or *ADOM*, losing a high-level character can be devastating, but the lessons learned along the way
prepare players for future runs.

However, in longer campaigns or more expansive roguelikes, permadeath can become overly punishing. Imagine losing dozens
of hours of progress in a sprawling, story-driven roguelike -- a frustration that could turn away even dedicated
players. To address this, many modern games implement alternatives such as:

- **Partial resets**, where players retain some progress or resources between runs.
- **Intermittent checkpoints**, offering a chance to recover from defeat without completely starting over.
- **Recoverable conditions**, such as penalties that can be offset through in-game actions.

These systems allow for a more forgiving experience while preserving the tension and challenge that make roguelikes
unique.

#### Permissible Meta-Progression
While roguelikes traditionally emphasize self-contained runs, some meta-progression can add depth and replayability
without undermining the genre’s core principles. Persistent elements such as unlockable character classes, subtle
upgrades, or narrative expansions reward long-term engagement while leaving the core challenge intact.

For instance, games like *FTL* allow players to unlock new ships or layouts after achieving specific milestones, providing
variety without diminishing the tension of individual runs. Similarly, lore-based progression, as seen in *ADOM*,
enhances the world’s richness while keeping each playthrough unpredictable.

In my view, the best meta-progression systems enhance the roguelike experience by encouraging exploration and
experimentation, rather than just making the game easier. They offer players something to work toward over time,
but they never overshadow the immediacy and high stakes of each individual run.

### Emergent Complexity
Roguelikes stand out for their ability to create systems that interact in surprising and meaningful ways. Instead of
relying on pre-scripted scenarios, these games thrive on emergent gameplay, where a combination of mechanics and
player choices results in unique, often unexpected outcomes. This complexity keeps players engaged by encouraging
experimentation and rewarding creative problem-solving.

#### Interlocking Systems
The best roguelikes create a web of interconnected systems that constantly interact. Environmental hazards, enemy
behaviors, and player abilities are designed to influence one another, often in ways that feel organic rather than
scripted. For instance, a fireball spell might ignite flammable terrain, setting off a chain reaction that alters the
course of an encounter.

This interactivity drives engagement by encouraging players to think beyond immediate problems and consider the broader
implications of their actions. Games like *Dwarf Fortress (in Adventure Mode)* exemplify this, offering systems so deeply
interconnected that even small changes ripple outward in unpredictable ways.


#### Living, Reactive Worlds
A reactive game world amplifies the sense of agency and immersion. In my opinion, the most engaging roguelikes feature
environments that respond dynamically to player decisions, creating opportunities for both success and failure.
Factions might shift their alliances, creatures could adapt to repeated strategies, or the world itself might evolve
based on the player’s impact.

For example, *Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead (CDDA)* offers the option of keeping the same persistent world across multiple
runs. When a character dies, everything that occurred in that playthrough -- destroyed buildings, altered vehicles, dropped
items -- remains for the next survivor to discover or reclaim. It’s possible to encounter your previous corpse or salvage
your former equipment, lending a tangible feeling that the world remembers and reflects the consequences of each run.
This continuity shifts the perspective from a lone survivor’s story to an ongoing, emergent narrative in a single,
evolving environment.

By weaving reactivity into their systems, roguelikes encourage players to consider the broader impact of every choice,
strengthening both the challenge and the sense of immersion.

## III. Movement, Positioning, and Interface
Tactical movement and positioning lie at the core of roguelike gameplay. The ability to assess the battlefield and make
purposeful choices about where to move -- or when to hold position -- can mean the difference between survival and defeat.
A clear and intuitive interface is essential to support these decisions, ensuring players have the information they
need to play the game effectively.

### Tactical Spatial Clarity
Roguelikes thrive on providing players with clear spatial mechanics that allow for meaningful positional decisions.
Whether the design uses grids, hexes, or discrete zones, the key is ensuring that each movement feels deliberate.
For instance, *Into the Breach* uses a tile-based system to highlight every action’s consequences, giving players complete
visibility into potential outcomes.

    alt="Into the Breach, Subset Games"
    description="Screenshot of Into the Breach, a turn-based hybrid roguelike, demonstrating its tile-based system that
    emphasizes strategic positional decisions and action consequences."
/>

*Terminus: Zombie Survivors* offers an alternative approach by combining a graph-based overworld map with grid-based nodes
for each specific building or structure. On the overworld, players choose their next destination node from a web of
interconnected points. Once inside a node, movement and combat occur on a grid, governed by action points that determine
how many moves or actions can be taken before ending the turn. After the player uses these points, zombies move in
response, reinforcing the importance of thoughtful positioning and resourceful tactics.

By blending a broad, node-based travel map with localized grid-based environments, the game ensures that every
decision -- from where to go next to how to maneuver through a cramped building -- carries significant tactical weight.

### Aesthetic Freedom
While roguelikes have traditionally embraced ASCII or tile-based visuals, the genre has grown to accommodate a wide
variety of art styles. Whether a game uses pixel art, 3D models, a hybrid aesthetic, or even ASCII(!), the visual design
should prioritize readability above all else.

For example, a game might use color coding or subtle animations to differentiate terrain types or enemy behaviors.
The focus should remain on ensuring that players can parse the environment at a glance, allowing for quick and informed
decision-making without sacrificing immersion.

### Seamless Flow
Many classic roguelikes integrate exploration and combat seamlessly, with both occurring in the same continuous space.
This approach often enhances immersion, as players transition fluidly between tactical planning and action. However,
segmented systems -- such as card-based mechanics in *Slay the Spire* -- or modal systems, like those used in
*Terminus: Zombie Survivors*, can also work effectively if they maintain the game’s emphasis on thoughtful
decision-making.

*Terminus: Zombie Survivors* exemplifies this by balancing its modal combat with a dynamic overworld exploration system,
ensuring that the flow of the game remains consistent and engaging. While the combat is distinct from the movement
phase, the design preserves the tension and stakes of every decision, a hallmark of the roguelike experience.

## IV. Resource Management and Exploration
Roguelikes challenge players to make the most of limited resources while navigating unpredictable environments.
The scarcity of supplies creates a constant tension, forcing players to weigh risks and rewards as they explore.
Every decision -- from using a health potion to venturing into an unknown area -- can have significant consequences, making
resource management and exploration central to the roguelike experience.

### Scarcity and Allocation
Effective resource management lies at the heart of roguelike gameplay. Players are often faced with difficult choices,
such as whether to use a health potion now or save it for a potentially more dangerous encounter later. This
scarcity heightens the stakes, turning even routine encounters into moments of strategic planning.

In games like *FTL*, players must carefully allocate limited resources, knowing that overspending
on one resource could leave them vulnerable later. Similarly, in *Brogue* and others, food management adds another
layer of tension, as prolonged exploration risks starvation. This constant pressure encourages players to think ahead,
prioritize their needs, and adapt their strategies on the fly.

### Secrets and Risk-Reward Discovery

Exploration in roguelikes is often about more than simply grabbing an amulet and then finding the exit -- it’s about
uncovering hidden opportunities and navigating the dangers that come with them. Many games hide rare loot, secret
passageways, or powerful artifacts in hard-to-reach or hazardous areas, tempting players to take risks for potential
rewards.

For instance, in *DCSS*, players often encounter treasure vaults or heavily guarded chambers containing
valuable equipment or consumables. Accessing these rewards usually requires defeating powerful enemies or navigating
environmental hazards, forcing players to weigh the potential gain against the risks to their survival. These mechanics
reward players who carefully assess their surroundings and take calculated risks.

### Adaptive Tactics

Procedural generation ensures that no two runs are the same, requiring players to continuously adapt their tactics to
new challenges. Each map layout, enemy spawn, or resource placement demands fresh strategies, preventing players from
relying solely on memorization.

In games like *FTL* or *Jupiter Hell*, players often face situations where their initial plans must evolve based on the
resources available or the threats encountered. This adaptability keeps gameplay dynamic and ensures that players are
always engaged, responding to the unique challenges of each run.

## V. Reduced Emphasis on Grand Strategy
Roguelikes tend to focus on immediate, tactical decisions rather than long-term strategic planning. While some games
incorporate higher-level systems, the heart of the roguelike experience lies in responding to challenges as they arise.
This immediacy creates a sense of urgency and tension that defines the genre, ensuring that moment-to-moment gameplay
remains engaging and impactful.

### Immediate Stakes
Unlike strategy games that emphasize overarching plans and resource management over extended timelines, roguelikes
prioritize the here and now. Each decision -- whether it’s choosing when to heal, where to move, or how to engage an
enemy -- has immediate consequences that shape the outcome of a run.

For example, in *Jupiter Hell*, players must carefully balance their positioning and ability usage in every combat
scenario, as a single misstep can result in swift death. This focus on short-term stakes keeps the player’s attention
on the tactical layer, where split-second choices and improvisation determine survival.

### Balancing Meta-Layers
While some roguelikes integrate strategic elements, these systems are usually secondary to the immediate challenges of
each run. Games like *Darkest Dungeon II* explore evolving relationships and larger-scale planning, but the roguelike core
remains tied to tactical decision-making within individual encounters.

In my view, roguelikes benefit most when these meta-layers enhance, rather than overshadow, the immediacy of
moment-to-moment gameplay. For example, *FTL* incorporates strategic decisions about which sectors to explore, but the
game’s focus remains on navigating encounters and managing resources in real-time (although the player can pause at any
point). This balance ensures that players stay immersed in the high-stakes tension that defines the genre.

## VI. Deprecated/Removed BI Elements
As the roguelike genre evolves, certain elements from the original Berlin Interpretation (BI) are arguably no longer
essential. While these features played a significant role in defining early roguelikes, modern interpretations have
shown that their absence doesn’t detract from the genre’s core identity. Instead, the focus has shifted toward
principles that better reflect the diversity of contemporary designs.

### Weakened Permadeath
Traditionally, permadeath was a cornerstone of roguelikes, ensuring that every run carried significant risk. However,
in longer or more complex games, this all-or-nothing mechanic can alienate players by erasing hours of progress after a
single mistake.

Modern roguelikes often adapt permadeath to better suit their design. For example, *Caves of Qud* offers two optional
non-permadeath difficulty mode with checkpoints, allowing players to recover from setbacks without starting over
completely. This approach preserves the tension of permadeath while offering a less punishing experience for those who
prefer it.

By softening the consequences without eliminating them, these games maintain the stakes that define roguelikes while
accommodating a broader range of players.

### Grid-Based Mandate
Grid-based movement has long been a hallmark of roguelikes, providing clarity and structure to tactical decisions.
However, it is no longer an absolute requirement. Games like *Terminus: Zombie Survivors* demonstrate that alternative
movement systems -- such as Action Points and graph-based overworld navigation -- can offer equally engaging spatial
mechanics.

The key lies in maintaining tactical clarity. Whether using a grid, hexes, or free-form movement, the design should
provide players with enough information to make meaningful choices about positioning and movement. The format is less
important than the system’s ability to support deliberate, strategic play.

### ASCII Requirement
ASCII graphics hold a special place in roguelike history, serving as both a visual style and a practical necessity for
early games. While still beloved by some players, modern roguelikes have embraced a variety of aesthetics.
Pixel art, 3D models, and even hybrid approaches can all work effectively, provided they prioritize readability and
clarity.

For instance, *Jupiter Hell* uses high-quality 3D visuals to represent its environments and characters while retaining
the tactical clarity of its ASCII predecessors. By moving beyond ASCII without sacrificing usability, these games
demonstrate that visual innovation can enhance a roguelike’s appeal.

Other games, including *Brogue* and *Cogmind* provide the option of choosing ASCII or graphical tiles in-game.

### Strict Non-Modality
Classic roguelikes often integrated exploration and combat seamlessly within a single interface. While this approach
remains effective, modern roguelikes have shown that modal systems can work just as well. Games like *FTL* segment
different phases of gameplay -- such as exploration and ship combat -- but maintain a cohesive and strategic experience.

The key is to preserve the player’s focus on tactical decision-making. If a modal system enhances clarity or adds depth
to specific mechanics, it can be a worthwhile departure from the traditional roguelike formula. In fact, if I recall
correctly, one of the unspoken reasons for specifying non-modality was to differentiated roguelikes from JRPGs.
However, I think that they have sufficient other differentiating factors such that a roguelike with modality is unlikely
to be confused for a JRPG.

### Dungeon-Centric Settings
While many roguelikes take place in sprawling dungeons, the genre’s defining principles -- emergent gameplay, resource
management, and high-stakes exploration -- can be applied to a wide range of settings. Space stations, post-apocalyptic
landscapes, and even abstract environments can serve as compelling backdrops for roguelike gameplay.

For example, *Approaching Infinity* trades traditional dungeon crawling for starship exploration and planetary away
missions, proving that a roguelike’s core identity transcends its setting. As long as the game fosters tension and
unpredictability, the environment can be as varied as the designer’s imagination allows.

## VII. Roguelike vs. Roguelite
The terms “roguelike” and “roguelite” are often used interchangeably, but they represent distinct branches of the genre.
While they share foundational elements like procedural generation and high replayability, their core design philosophies
differ significantly. Understanding these distinctions helps clarify what sets traditional roguelikes apart from their
more action-oriented counterparts.

### Roguelikes
Roguelikes emphasize methodical pacing, systemic depth, and high-stakes gameplay. These games challenge
players to navigate procedurally generated environments while making deliberate, tactical decisions. Each run is largely
self-contained, with minimal reliance on persistent upgrades or meta-progression.

Examples of traditional roguelikes include:
-	*Caves of Qud*: Known for its deep simulation, faction interactions, and unpredictable outcomes.
-	*Jupiter Hell*: A sci-fi roguelike that combines turn-based tactics with fast-paced decision-making.
-	*Brogue*: A grid-based, turn-based roguelike focusing on resource management and tactical combat.
-   *Cogmind*: A traditional roguelike that deeply adheres to classic roguelike mechanics while
        introducing innovative elements unique to its high-tech theme.
-   *Rogue Fable IV*: A modern traditional roguelike that stays true to classic mechanics while adding features for
        greater depth and accessibility.

These games prioritize risk and adaptability, with the ever-present possibility of catastrophic failure keeping players
engaged.


### Roguelites
Roguelites, by contrast, often incorporate elements of reflex-driven gameplay or extensive meta-progression. They appeal
to a broader audience by softening the genre’s traditional difficulty curve and introducing systems that reward
incremental progress across runs.

Examples of roguelites include:
-	*Hades*: Combines fast-paced combat with a deep narrative and persistent upgrades.
-	*Dead Cells*: Fuses platforming and hack-and-slash combat with unlockable weapons and abilities.
-	*Rogue Legacy*: Features generational meta-progression, where each new character inherits traits and upgrades from
    previous runs.
-	*Heroes of Hammerwatch 1 and 2*: Blends action RPG mechanics with procedural generation and persistent town upgrades.
-	*Binding of Isaac*: Features fast-paced, reflex-heavy gameplay with incremental unlocks and item progression across
    runs.

While roguelites borrow mechanics from roguelikes, their focus on reflexes and progression systems places them in a
separate category.

#### Relationship
Roguelikes and roguelites are not in competition -- they are complementary approaches to the same foundational ideas.
Roguelites introduce the genre’s concepts to players who may be unfamiliar with its traditional structure, while
roguelikes maintain the tactical depth and emergent complexity that define the genre’s roots. Together, they expand the
roguelike family, offering something for every type of player.

## VIII. Traditional Roguelikes

Traditional roguelikes represent the direct descendants of early genre-defining titles like *Rogue* itself, *NetHack*, and *ADOM*.
These games adhere closely to the foundational concepts that shaped the genre’s formative years, emphasizing discrete,
turn-based movement, single-character progression, and harsh penalties for failure. In doing so, they uphold the genre’s
heritage by focusing on methodical decision-making and survival-oriented play rather than reflex-based action or
extensive meta-progression.

### Core Qualities

Though the roguelike genre has broadened substantially, traditional roguelikes remain bound by a few distinct features
that set them apart:
#### Strict Turn-Based Pacing
- Every action -- movement, attacking, using an item -- advances time by a discrete step. This ensures that players can
deliberate over each decision without facing the pressure of a ticking clock.
#### Singular Character Focus
- Many traditional roguelikes place the player in control of exactly one primary character. This intense focus on a
single survivor or hero heightens tension because defeat spells the end of the entire run.
#### Grid-Based Navigation
- Movement typically unfolds on a square or (occasionally) a hex grid, simplifying the geometry of combat and exploration.
This design grants clarity to tactical maneuvers, making precise positioning a critical element of success.
#### Minimal to No Meta-Progression
- In traditional roguelikes, each run stands on its own. Death means losing all progress and items. While some titles may
include optional unlocks or class additions, the emphasis remains on learning the game’s systems rather than accruing
permanent upgrades across multiple attempts.
#### ASCII or Simple Tile Aesthetic
- Many classic roguelikes rely on ASCII or basic tile sets, though visuals vary widely in modern counterparts. Regardless
of style, readability and conveying vital information are always prioritized over pretty graphics.

### Lasting Appeal
For many players, the allure of traditional roguelikes lies in their uncompromising approach to challenge and
consequence. Permadeath rewards patience and planning, pushing players to learn from mistakes and refine their
strategies. By restricting meta-systems that carry over between runs, these games reinforce the importance of
moment-to-moment decisions and the organic mastery of complex systems.

### Contemporary Role

Modern roguelikes and roguelites have introduced faster pacing, reflex elements, and persistent upgrades, but
traditional roguelikes continue to thrive in both classic and newly developed titles. They provide a counterbalance to
more action-focused designs, offering a pure, methodical experience that remains beloved by those who prefer careful
deliberation, emergent complexity, and the high stakes of permanent failure.

By acknowledging these roots, developers and players can appreciate the breadth of the genre -- from its hardcore,
old-school constraints to the varied, innovative forms it takes today.

## **IX. Case Studies**
Examining specific games helps illustrate the diversity within the roguelike and roguelite genres, showcasing how
different design choices align with -- or diverge from -- the core principles discussed. Below, I’ve selected a few
examples that highlight these distinctions.

### Included: Roguelikes (Traditional and Systemic)

Roguelikes emphasize systemic depth, procedural generation, and high-stakes gameplay. While traditional roguelikes
often feature turn-based mechanics and grid-based movement, the category has grown to include games that maintain the
genre’s tactical focus and emergent complexity, even with alternative approaches to pacing and interface. These games
challenge players to adapt to unpredictable environments, with each run offering unique challenges and opportunities.

#### *Caves of Qud*
- This modernized roguelike exemplifies emergent complexity and procedural depth. Its faction systems and richly simulated
world allow for unpredictable, highly personalized experiences. Players might encounter a wandering merchant one run and
find themselves on the wrong side of their faction the next. This variability reinforces the game’s tactical depth and
replayability, firmly placing it within the traditional roguelike category.

#### *Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (DCSS)*

- This critically acclaimed roguelite combines fast-paced combat with a rich narrative and persistent meta-progression.
Its reflex-driven gameplay and extensive upgrades distinguish it from traditional roguelikes, appealing to players who
prefer action-oriented mechanics.

#### *Dead Cells*
- Blending procedural generation with fluid platforming combat, *Dead Cells* exemplifies the roguelite approach. Unlockable
weapons and abilities provide long-term progression, while its reflex-heavy gameplay moves away from the tactical pacing
of roguelikes.

#### *Rogue Legacy*
- Well known for its generational progression system, *Rogue Legacy* allows players to invest in upgrades that persist across
runs. While it retains a run-based structure, the focus on long-term character growth sets it firmly in the roguelite
camp.

#### *Binding of Isaac*
- Reflex-based combat, procedural generation, and persistent upgrades. *Binding of Isaac* emphasizes fast-paced gameplay,
with unlockable items and abilities that carry over between runs. While procedural elements align with roguelikes,

#### *Heroes of Hammerwatch 1 and 2*
- Action RPG mechanics, procedural dungeons, and persistent town upgrades. *Heroes of Hammerwatch 1 and 2* integrate roguelite
progression systems, where players improve their characters and town infrastructure across multiple runs. The emphasis
on action-driven combat and carryover progression places them firmly in the roguelite category.

#### *Spelunky 1 and 2*
- Platforming, procedural generation, and reflex-heavy gameplay. *Spelunky 1 and 2* incorporate roguelike randomness
but rely on player reflexes and precise timing to navigate their environments. The games lack traditional roguelike
tactical pacing, making them the quintessential roguelites.

#### *Diablo*
- Procedural generation, loot-based progression, and persistent character development. While *Diablo* leans heavily on
action RPG mechanics, along with a rigid story and set pieces, its use of randomization and high replayability align
it with roguelite design principles. Unlike traditional roguelikes, it focuses on real-time combat and long-term
character upgrades, making it more accessible to a broader audience.

### Hybrid Roguelike
Hybrid roguelikes blend traditional roguelike mechanics with elements from other genres, creating unique gameplay
experiences. These games often incorporate tactical decision-making while introducing innovations that set them apart
from conventional roguelikes.

#### *Dwarf Fortress (Fortress Mode)*
- Combines traditional roguelike elements like procedural generation and emergent complexity with colony management and
simulation mechanics. In Fortress Mode, players oversee the construction and operation of a sprawling settlement,
managing resources, citizens, and external threats.
The roguelike influence is evident in the unpredictability of events, the high stakes of decisions, and the emergent
storytelling that arises from interactions between the environment, creatures, and dwarves. However, its focus on
large-scale planning and indirect control over individual units places it firmly in the hybrid category, blending
roguelike principles with a deep simulation experience.

#### *KeeperRL*
- Grid-based movement, turn-based mechanics, and a mix of roguelike and simulation elements. *KeeperRL* combines
traditional dungeon-building mechanics with roguelike exploration and combat, allowing players to control both
individual units and broader dungeon systems.

#### *Balatro*
- Combines roguelike principles with deck-building mechanics and a focus on improvisational gameplay. *Balatro* tasks
players with building and managing a deck of cards as they navigate procedurally generated challenges. The game
emphasizes adaptability, as the random nature of card draws and events requires players to adjust their strategies on
the fly.
Like traditional roguelikes, *Balatro* features high-stakes decision-making, where each play or resource expenditure can
significantly impact the outcome of a run. However, its use of deck-building mechanics places it in the hybrid category,
blending the emergent complexity of roguelikes with the planning and synergies typical of card-based games.

#### *Slay the Spire*
- Merges deck-building card game mechanics with roguelike progression. Players ascend a procedurally generated spire,
battling enemies through turn-based card combat. Each run offers different cards and relics, encouraging players to
adapt their strategies and build unique decks to overcome challenges

#### *Darkest Dungeon II*
- This sequel builds upon its predecessor’s focus on party-based tactics and resource management but introduces deeper
narrative integration and persistent progression systems. While each combat encounter requires strategic, moment-to-moment
decisions consistent with roguelike principles, the overarching story and legacy systems provide continuity and
long-term objectives.

#### *Invisible, Inc.*
- This game merges traditional roguelike elements, such as procedurally generated missions and turn-based tactical
decision-making, with strategic team management features commonly found in strategy games like *XCOM*. *Invisible, Inc.*
focuses on controlling a small team of agents, requiring players to manage resources, plan coordinated actions, and
make strategic decisions at both the mission and operational levels.

## X. Addressing Community Concerns
The roguelike community is diverse, encompassing players, developers, and enthusiasts with varied perspectives on what
defines the genre. As the genre evolves, certain concerns and debates have emerged, often centered around preserving
tradition while embracing innovation. This section addresses some of the most common points of contention.

### Legacy Respect

Roguelikes trace their roots to foundational titles like *Rogue*, *NetHack*, *Moria* and *Angbad*.
For many in the community, these early games represent the heart of the genre, establishing key principles such as
procedural generation, high-stakes gameplay, and emergent complexity.

While innovation is essential for keeping the genre alive, it’s important to respect these traditions. This doesn’t
mean rigid adherence to past conventions but rather maintaining the core elements that made roguelikes distinctive.
For example, modern games like *Caves of Qud* and *Jupiter Hell* have successfully built on traditional frameworks while
introducing fresh ideas. By preserving the genre’s defining principles, developers can ensure its legacy remains intact.

### Gatekeeping Guardrails

Defining what constitutes a roguelike has always been a challenge, leading to heated debates within the community.
Clear distinctions, such as those provided by frameworks like the Berlin Interpretation or this one, help clarify these
boundaries.

For instance, while games like *Hades* and *Dead Cells* share certain elements with roguelikes, they lack the tactical
pacing and emergent complexity that define the core experience. These distinctions aren’t meant to gatekeep but to
preserve the genre’s identity and guide players and developers in understanding what sets roguelikes apart. At the
same time, the roguelike family has expanded to include hybrids and roguelites, offering room for innovation without
diluting its core.


### Cultural Conflation

As “roguelike” has become an industry buzzword, its meaning has often been stretched to encompass games that share only
superficial similarities with the genre. Marketing labels frequently misrepresent roguelikes, leading to confusion among
players and developers alike.

The term ‘roguelike’ is often misapplied to games with superficial similarities, diluting its meaning. For instance:

- *Returnal* markets itself as a roguelike but emphasizes real-time combat and cinematic storytelling over tactical
decision-making.

- *Cult of the Lamb*, although often labeled otherwise, is not a roguelike because it features real-time action,
incorporates persistent progression and base-building mechanics, focuses on managing a cult rather than a single
character, and lacks traditional roguelike elements like turn-based, grid-based movement and permanent consequences.

- *Vampire Survivors* is frequently mislabeled as a roguelike despite its arcade-style action and minimal consequence
for failure.

These examples highlight the need for precise terminology. Distinguishing roguelikes (tactical, systemic, high-stakes)
from roguelites (action-oriented, meta-progression-heavy) preserves the genre’s identity and guides players to experiences
aligned with their preferences.

This mislabeling risks diminishing the value of the term, making it harder for genuine roguelikes to stand out.
Encouraging thoughtful and accurate labeling -- such as distinguishing between roguelikes (and/or traditional roguelikes),
roguelites, and hybrids -- helps preserve the genre’s integrity. By doing so, the community can ensure that roguelikes
retain their distinct identity while allowing room for diverse interpretations and innovations.

## XI. Creative Freedom and Evolution

The roguelike genre has always been a space for experimentation and innovation. Its core principles -- procedural
generation, emergent complexity, and high-stakes decision-making -- serve as a foundation that developers can build upon,
exploring new ideas and pushing the boundaries of what the genre can achieve.


### Technology and Player Preferences
Advances in technology have opened up new opportunities for roguelike design. Procedural generation has grown more
sophisticated, allowing for dynamic narratives, evolving environments, and systems-driven gameplay that reacts to player
choices. For example, AI-driven content creation could enable NPCs with unique goals and behaviors, adding depth to
procedural worlds.

Player preferences have also shifted, with many seeking more approachable or visually engaging experiences. Games like
*Jupiter Hell* demonstrate that roguelikes can embrace modern visuals while retaining their tactical depth. Similarly,
hybrids like *KeeperRL* show how blending genres can attract new audiences while preserving roguelike
principles.

### Adaptive Definition
The roguelike genre’s ability to adapt has been key to its longevity. Rather than adhering to rigid checklists, modern
interpretations embrace the genre’s spirit -- tactical pacing, emergent gameplay, and meaningful consequences -- while
allowing for variation.

This flexibility ensures that roguelikes remain relevant in an ever-changing gaming landscape. Developers are free to
experiment with new mechanics, aesthetics, or narrative techniques, provided they enhance the genre’s core appeal.
For example, games like *Loop Hero*, *Rift Wizard (1 and 2)* and *Slay the Spire* reimagine traditional roguelike elements in
innovative ways, expanding the genre’s possibilities without losing its essence.

## XII. Conclusion
The "hiive interpretation" framework is not meant to be a rigid set of rules but rather a tool for discussion and
reflection. Just as the roguelike genre itself evolves, the hiive interpretation should adapt to accommodate new ideas,
technologies, and player preferences. Its purpose is to preserve the genre’s core identity while encouraging innovation
and diversity within its boundaries.

### Living Document
By design, the hiive interpretation is intended to grow and change. Developers, players, and enthusiasts are invited to
critique, refine, and expand upon its guidelines. This collaborative approach ensures that the framework remains
relevant, reflecting the evolving landscape of roguelikes while maintaining respect for their roots.

For example, as hybrids and roguelites continue to emerge, this interpretation can help clarify how these variations
relate to traditional roguelikes, providing useful distinctions without discouraging creative exploration. The goal is
not to divide but to celebrate the genre’s diversity and richness.

### Call to Action
If this framework sparks new ideas -- or sparks debate -- it has succeeded in its purpose. The roguelike genre thrives
on iteration, both in its gameplay and in how it’s understood. Developers are encouraged to experiment, players to
engage, and communities to discuss and refine what makes roguelikes so compelling.

### Final Pitch
Roguelikes remain a unique and vibrant part of the gaming world, defined by their tactical depth, emergent storytelling,
and unpredictable challenges. Roguelites, while distinct, offer complementary experiences that expand the genre’s reach.

The hiive interpretation seeks to preserve the essential spirit of roguelikes while leaving room for growth,
experimentation, and reinterpretation.

By keeping these principles in mind, the roguelike community can continue to innovate and collaborate, ensuring that the
genre remains as compelling and dynamic as ever.
