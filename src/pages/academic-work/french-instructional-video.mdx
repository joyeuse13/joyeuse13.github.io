    # French Instructional Video

    The following video was created by myself and four classmates (Betùl Bal, Francisco Barrón, Lauren Larsen, and Janet
    Randall) in spring of 2010 for Technology in the ESL Classroom, taught by Dr. Eric Friginal, at GA State University.

    The target audience for the video is a class of low-intermediate level students for French as a foreign language.
    It features interviews with speakers from several Francophonic countries, with the purpose of raising students'
    awareness of both the diversity of the French language, and the socio-cultural status of French in the different
    regions of the French-speaking world.

    Pedagogical possibilities for using the video in a classroom include:
        - Listening comprehension exercises
        - Presentation of communicative functions such as introductions and descriptions
        - Introduction to a learning unit about French language and culture
