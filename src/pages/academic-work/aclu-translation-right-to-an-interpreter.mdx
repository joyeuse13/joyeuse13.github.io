    # ACLU Translation - Right to an Interpreter

    In October 2010, Georgia ACLU were investigating the failure of state courts to provide translators for persons of
    limited English proficiency, as they are required to do by law. The ACLU had created a document to inform people of
    their rights, and asked for volunteers to translate it into various languages.  I did the French translation.
