    # Professional Development Reflections

    ### Integrating Second Life into an EFL Program

    ##### GA State University, Atlanta, GA

    **April 2010**

    I participated in a research study exploring possible uses of Second Life as a medium for teaching distance learning
    EFL classes.   The format was simple: every week, we logged into SL, looked for a Chinese student to talk to, and
    started talking about the assigned topic for that week.  Unfortunately, it didn't go very well.

    We were plagued with constant technical problems— in the first session the audio was full of echoes and static, and
    the in the second session, it was possible to hear not only my conversation partner, but seemingly everyone else in
    the computer lab in China!  Furthermore, part of the project involve commenting on the Chinese students’ blog
    entries, but the blogs were set up on a Google site, which was blocked in China.

    Completely aside from the technical issues, however, was the fact that the researchers didn’t really seem aware of
    what Second Life was, and what it could do.  The sessions were not set up to take advantage of SL as a virtual
    environment where anything was possible.  There were no tasks or quests, no aspects of the environment with which to
    interact (all aspects of other educational experiments with SL); rather we were required to read a short (obviously
    inauthentic) essay on the assigned topic, and then stand around and talk about it.

    Right off the bat, it was hard to identify the people we were supposed to be talking to, because they all had user
    names comprised of what I’m assuming were their professors’ names and a number.  In addition, sometimes other random
    SL users would wander into the area and want to know what’s going on, and it could take a few minutes to realize
    they weren’t part of the research project.

    The assigned topics had little or nothing to do with the virtual environment—usually an empty field or a building
    with a meeting room.  For example, one week’s session took place near a zoo—except the microphones didn’t work
    inside the zoo.  Apparently we were supposed to walk around ourselves, then exit the zoo to find a conversation
    partner, which sort of defeated the purpose of giving us an environment to spark conversation.  Secondly, the
    conversation topic didn’t have to do with the zoo at all—we were supposed to talk about pet ownership, not zoo
    animals.  Finally, and most confusingly, the researchers had not set up the zoo environment for their own purposes;
    rather, they were borrowing an environment from another group which must have been in Europe, because all the signs
    in the zoo were in German!   This didn’t really matter, since none of the text was relevant to our project, but it
    was disorienting, and made me wonder at first if I was in the right place.

    Another problem with this project was that, although we had been given specific instructions not to depart from the
    assigned topics,  they were very limiting.  We were given a set of questions to ask the Chinese students, but those
    were pretty quickly exhausted, leaving us with no choice but to talk about our families and the weather if we wanted
    to keep conversing for the assigned time slot.

    To be sure, SL has its flaws as a CMC medium.  Since we couldn’t see our partners’ real faces, it was hard to
    develop any sense of social presence; furthermore, we lost the opportunity to read lips or body language.  However,
    I think the biggest mistake this project made was in assuming that SL was primarily a CMC medium.  The CMC is
    merely a byproduct of the virtual reality; once this is understood, it becomes easier to conceive of educational
    projects that could really shine with this tool.  For example, students could collaborate in a quest or a scavenger
    hunt, or learn to manipulate the landscape and create their own environments

    It was really a shame that the researchers had not given more thought to how best to leverage Second Life’s unique
    opportunities.  I’m sure their results will show very little improvement in their students’ work, and I would
    hate to see them conclude that there aren’t any benefits to using SL for this purpose.
