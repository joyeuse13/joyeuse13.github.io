    ### Science Fiction in Translation: the Works of Anne McCaffrey

    ##### Dragon*Con, Atlanta, GA

    **September 2009**

    In this panel we read and discussed excerpts from Anne McCaffrey’s 1986 novel Dragonflight in English, French,
    Spanish, German, and Danish.

    Translating science fiction has a special set of circumstances.  Character and place names, for example, are
    unlikely to be translatable, since they are often made up by the author.  In some cases, they are even
    unpronounceable!  For example, one of the main characters in the excerpt we read was named “Jora.”  In most of
    the languages we read in, there is no way to spell the English phoneme /dʒ/.  Instead, the Spanish reader, for
    example, changed the sound to /h/, and the German reader to /j/.  In French, I read it as  /ʒ/, and accented the
    last syllable, as is common in French words.

    In addition, science fiction often includes many coined words, which share the problem of the names, but have
    added complications.  The translator can either use the same word the author coined in English, and try to include
    a parenthetical explanation of its meaning, or—more difficult—try to find an equivalent set of morphemes in the
    target language that will evoke the same associations in the mind of the reader as the original coinage would for an
    English reader.  An example of this in the McCaffrey novel was “watchwher,” a semi-intelligent reptilian species.
    The word “wher” is a coinage, and thus cannot be translated, but the first part of the compound, “watch,” is
    important in letting the reader know that whatever the wher is, it’s a creature that guards, like a watchdog.
    A translator must decide how to combine the translated concept of “watch” or “guard” with the coined morpheme
    “wher,” and possibly whether or not to attempt to create a target-language permissible set of phonemes to replace
    the English-permissible coinage.  In the German translation, for example, the entire term “watchwher” was lifted
    wholesale into the translation, but the French translator decided to use the French word for “watch,” and called it
    a “wher de guard,” in the same manner as a “chien de guard” (watchdog).

    The passage we were examining opened with a short poem.  In German and Danish, this poem had been translated for
    meaning, but lost its poetic quality and rhyme scheme.  In French and Spanish, the translators had made an effort
    to preserve the rhyme scheme, but had changed some of the meanings slightly.  We agreed that this choice was not in
    itself good or bad, but depended on how well the translator understood the story, and how true the translation
    remained to the poem’s purpose therein.

    We also discussed whether we felt it was necessary to be a native speaker to be a translator.  Of our panelists,
    only one was a native speaker of the language they were reading in, and he felt that native proficiency was key
    to translating both accurately and in such a way as to maintain the “feel” of the text.  I was the only one who had
    actually done professional translation work, and I pointed out that, although my translations from English to French
    were correct, it was nevertheless easy for native speakers to tell that they had been written by a foreigner.
    This wasn’t even for fiction, but rather for the more mundane task of writing software instructions—imagine, then,
    the jarring difference it would make for readers of fiction to encounter translations that, while correct, still
    sound—not quite right.

    We also agreed that translating science fiction would be a different task from translating mainstream fiction or
    non-fiction.  There are certain conventions of the genre that it would be necessary for a translator to be familiar
    with, such as the above-mentioned coinages.  A translator unfamiliar with science fiction would be unlikely to
    understand what to do with those coinages, or with the themes and images common to the genre.
