At h<span style="color:#ffA707">i</span>ive<span style="color:#ffA707">labs</span>, the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning 
with game design leads to procedurally generated experiences that feel 
hand-crafted. This experimental project explores innovative AI techniques 
to develop immersive and engaging gaming environments that dynamically 
adapt to player actions and preferences. It also serves as an opportunity to 
delve into the Rust programming language, pushing the boundaries of both 
technology and creativity.

The mission of h<span style="color:#ffA707">i</span>ive<span style="color:#ffA707">labs</span> is to 
investigate how AI can enhance game design, ensuring that the generated content 
exhibits depth, coherence, and creativity. By focusing on key areas such as 
terrain generation, character development, quest creation, narrative design, 
and living worlds, h<span style="color:#ffA707">i</span>ive<span style="color:#ffA707">labs</span> 
aims to create unique adventures that are both dynamic and adaptive.
